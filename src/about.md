Hey, I'm Josh! üëãüèª

I am a determined life-long learner and creator, passionate about well-designed and meticulously crafted music, film, software, and more. I love to take on new challenges and learn new domains, and I enjoy sharing what I've learned with others.

In 2024 I moved from my home in Chicago to Tokyo to attend language school. While in school I studied intermediate and advanced Japanese and made friends who helped me expand the way I see the world. Check out my <a href="/videos">videos</a> to see some of my most recent adventures.

Thanks for joining me on my journey!

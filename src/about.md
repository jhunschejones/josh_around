Hey there! 👋🏻 My name is Josh Jones. I am a determined life-long learner and creator, as passionate about well-designed technology and software products as I am about meticulously crafted music and Japanese language learning. I love to take on new challenges and learn new domains that interest me. I also enjoy putting together experiments and sharing what I've learned along the way with others. Thanks for joining me on my journey!

In the last ten years, I've only used a few backpacks in total. Generally I've picked a bag from a local sporting goods store and stuck with it until it wore out. This simple approach has worked well in the environments I lived in where I am usually just going out to do one thing. That could be a long urban hike, a walk to the gym, a grocery run, or an outdoor adventure on vacation. With a single task ahead of me, it's easy to pick the right backpack for the task from my small collection of bags.

With my upcoming trip to Japan, I have decided to undertake the exciting task of attempting to find a single backpack that I can use for multiple tasks. This is in part motivated by the limited number of items I'll be able to bring with me, and in part by the anticipated changes in my everyday activities that this move will require. For example, it's likely that I will need to pack a single backpack in the morning with items for language school, the gym, and any errands I will need to run before returning home in the evening.

#### The big picture goals üéí

I started my search for this unicorn backpack as naively as any other experiment I've undertaken this year. I jumped in and started trying things out. I tried to use a realistic load-out of items to test what each bag could fit and how it felt. I would try to pack a bag for a day at school and the gym, then repack the bag with a smaller load for local excursions, then try again with the next pack. As I progressed through quite a few interesting backpacks, I started to discover that there are some key features I will need in order for this pack to work.

The most important feature for me is going to be the harness system. There is a good chance that my school commute or other adventures will involve standing in public transit for long periods of time. I need a bag that will still be comfortable in this environment, as well as on outdoor hikes and longer urban walks. This means a comfortable back panel, supportive shoulder straps, and adjustable sternum and waist straps.

The second thing I am looking at is the form-factor of the backpack. I want this bag to blend in while I am traversing an urban environment and I need it to be compact enough to comfortably take into crowds and on packed public transit. This rules out large, saggy, traditional school backpacks as well as massive, convertible travel backpacks. Instead I've gravitated toward subtle color ways and slimmer bags that keep the load secure and close to my back.

Finally, with all the effort I'm putting into this purchase, I would like to be intentional about the companies that I support. I'm looking for a company who respects the environment and is intentional about their human impact and supply chain. Luckily, there are more and more creative companies popping up each year and I've found a few who I'm really excited to purchase bags from.

#### Smaller features and tradeoffs ü§ùüèª

Aside from the big-picture features that I'm looking for, I've found some other nice-to-haves along the way. These include things like specific strap layouts, water bottle holders, certain kinds of organization, and of course pack color and design. What makes this experiment so fun is that there isn't just one bag that has all the small and big features I'm looking for. Each bag makes tradeoffs for what the designers thought was most important. My process has needed to evolve to become one of weighting tradeoffs to find which things I'm willing to pass up in order to land with a better overall backpack.

#### More to come!

My plan is to update this post with more bag experiment notes as I get closer to a final decision. So far I've narrowed the field down to a small handful of manufactures who I am interested in supporting. This has helped me go from infinity choices down to a more manageable amount of bags to try. As I make my way through these backpacks, I'm continuing to hone my search criteria and learning lots about what I like and don't like along the way. There are so many good backpacks out there in 2023, this is sure to be a great summer of experimentation!

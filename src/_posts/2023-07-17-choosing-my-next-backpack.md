In the last ten years, I've only used a few backpacks in total. Generally I've picked a bag from a sporting goods store and stuck with it until it wore out. This worked well in the environments I've lived in, as I am only ever leaving the house with a backpack in order to go out and do one thing. That could be a long urban hike, a walk to the gym, a grocery run, or an outdoor adventure on vacation. With a single task ahead of me, it's easy to pick the right backpack for the task from my small collection of bags.

With my upcoming trip to Japan, I have decided to undertake the exciting task of attempting to locate a single backpack that I can use for multiple tasks. This is in part motivated by the limited amount of items I'll be able to bring with me, and in part by the anticipated changes in my everyday activities that this move will require. For example, it's likely that I'll pack a single backpack in the morning with items for language school, the gym, and any errands I will need to run before returning home for the evening.

#### The big picture goals üéí

I started my search for the unicorn backpack as naively as any other experiment I've done this year. I jumped in and started trying out backpacks, using as close to a realistic load of items as possible. I would pack a bag for a day at school and the gym, then repack the bag with a smaller load for local excursions, then try again with the next pack. As I progressed through quite a few interesting backpacks, I started to realize there are some key features I will need in order for this pack to work.

The most important feature will be the harness system. There is a good chance that my school commute or other adventures will involve standing in public transit for long periods of time. I need a bag that will still be comfortable in this environment, as well as on outdoor hikes and longer urban walks.

In close second is the form factor of the backpack. I want this bag to blend in in an urban environment and enable me to navigate crowded streets and public transit without accidentally knocking into people around me.

#### Smaller features and tradeoffs ü§ùüèª

Aside from the big-picture features that I'm looking for, I've found some other nice-to-haves along the way. These include things like specific strap layouts, water bottle holders, certain kinds of organization, and of course pack color and design. What makes this experiment so fun is that there isn't one bag that lines up on all the small and big features I'm looking for. Each bag makes tradeoffs for what the designers thought was most important. My process then has to be one of weighting tradeoffs to find which things I'm willing to give up in order to get a better overall backpack.

#### More to come!

My plan is to update this post with more bag experiment notes as I get closer to a final decision. So far I've narrowed the field down to a small handful of manufactures who I am interested in supporting. This has helped me go from infinity choices down to a more manageable amount of bags to try. As I make my way through these backpacks, I'm continuing to hone my search criteria and learning lots about what I like and don't like along the way. There are so many good backpacks out there in 2023, this is sure to be a great summer of experimentation!

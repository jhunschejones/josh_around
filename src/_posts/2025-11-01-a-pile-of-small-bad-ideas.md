This week started out like any other since my move to Tokyo. As usual, I did my best to make progress on probably too many goals, obstacles arose, I persisted, and looking back, it went alright.

Here's what I realized though. The things that worked for me this week, whether it was in the land of language learning, nutrition, or sleep, they weren't the _best_ ideas. In fact, in some cases they were pretty much the scrappiest and least efficient option. But because something about them was sticky, they enabled me to make a small amount of progress in areas where I've been rather stuck recently.

### Word of the day

Let's use my newest study tool as an example. I found an app that will let me run a script on my computer and display the output in the menu bar. This week, I made a list of fifty Japanese words that come up often in meetings at work. Then I wrote a Ruby script to show me a new word each day, along with the sentence where I found the word. Now, when I check the time on my computer, I also sees a Japanese word I'm trying to learn up in the menu bar.

This wasn't the most efficient way to spend what should have been my study time, since I was basically just coding instead of learning. One could even argue that the final result of all this puttering isn't going to teach me a prolific amount of vocabulary, so was the point of putting in all that time?

But this is the exact kind of tool I'm talking about. A small, fairly bad idea, that, all the same, gets me a little closer to reaching one of my goals each day. My brain seems to believe that there are many, much better ideas out there, and I think that often leads me to self-sensor when I have small ideas that aren't perfect yet. Looking back at the time since I moved to Japan, it's clear that this approach of skipping the bad ideas and just waiting around for a better idea has resulted in very little progress indeed.

### Let's try something new

So, I'm going to try something different for the month of November. I picked three important areas where I'm trying to grow: Japanese language, photography, and writing. I'm want to see what I can achieve by stacking up a pile of small, bad ideas in these areas. My hope is that I'll be able to make more progress in a month than I've made since my move, and in doing so uncover a new path forward.

If nothing else, I'll know thirty-one more paths that don't lead anywhere interesting in particular, which is also more than I know know.

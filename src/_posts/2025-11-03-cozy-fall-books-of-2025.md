Well, it's official. I've fallen down what is possibly the most friendly of reading rabbit-holes: cozy non-fiction.

It all started because I was getting a little tired of the predominantly male self-help authors and biographers I had been reading over the summer. Some of them were quite good, but I couldn't escape the feeling that many seemed to be clenching every muscle in their body when they sat down to write. It's a helpful vibe for when you want to overcome and push through, but in the end it's not really me. I wanted something fresh, reflective, and welcoming, and so I started to seek out new storytellers and perspectives. Pretty soon though, what began as a relaxing side-quest became a new passion, and I think it's fair to say I'm hooked!

### Quick reflections on some favorites so far

I began with **_Braiding Sweetgrass_** by Robin Wall Kimmerer. She has a unique perspective and engaging storytelling voice that meant once I got into the book I had trouble putting it down. _Braiding Sweetgrass_ is a mix of cozy self-reflection and discussions around the intersection of science, indigenous wisdom, and how we might work together with each other and our planet to improve our collective futures.

From there I went on to **_Wintering_** by Katherine May. This book is a combination memoir and research piece that finds it's way as it goes. I enjoyed May's honest and unguarded reflections and the people whose stories she brought in alongside her own made it a colorful and encouraging work. Her book **_Enchantment_** was also a great read with similar vibes, perhaps even a little more laid back. In it, May takes a gentle stroll through some important themes around wonder and presence that didn't get as many pages in _Wintering_.

Next, really beginning to lean into the coze-factor, I picked up two shorter works, **_The Little Book of Hygge_** by Meik Wiking, and **_The Cottage Fairy Companion_** by Paola Merrill. These authors are masters of cozy living from two different cultural backgrounds. In my opinion, their gentle storytelling voices do a great job of bringing the reader in on the experience. I could almost feel the heat of candles in a cozy winter cabin, listening to their stories as steam poured off of a warm mug of tea.

The last two books I want to mention are **_Soulful Simplicity_** and **_Gentle_** by Courtney Carver. I tried reading Carver's book _Project 333_ last year, but it wasn't really for me. Luckily, I gave her other books a shot this fall and I'm so glad I did! She is a recovered high-achiever and I think that helps me receive her often counter-cultural wisdom with a more open mind. As I write this, I've only just started _Gentle_ and so far it's already shaping up to have the most takeaways of any I've read this fall!

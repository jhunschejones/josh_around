In 2024 I am embarking on a new adventure and moving from the United States to Japan. To prepare for the biggest move of my life to date, I began by investigating what I would need to bring for a smooth trip and (mostly) painless transition in a new country. Then, I tested my gear on a handful of 1-2 week trips within the United States in 2023, continuing to hone my travel rig to smooth out the rough edges.

#### Deciding what to bring ü§î
{: .action-header}

To start planning what items I would need to bring on my move, I created a spreadsheet of all the clothes, electronics, and toiletries that I was using each week. I found this to be a surprisingly illuminating process. In an attempt to simplify daily choices I had already built what I thought was a respectably minimalist wardrobe. What I found though, after counting everything I owned, was that because I washed my clothes once a week in a single, big load, I actually had way more clothing items than I thought. To make matters worse, I couldn't see a way out of the laundry cycle I was in because the antiperspirant deodorant I used requires strong enzymes to remove it from my cotton t-shirts before washing. This locked me in to buying cheap shirts by fast fashion brands, which would wear thin within a year or two.

To solve this problem I had to make a significant and methodical change to my daily routine. First I replaced my burley belt with a thinner, nylon belt that would not rub holes in the back of my t-shirts. Second, I changed my skin care routine to make cleaning my shirts easier, then finally I began to change out my shirts and the rest of the clothes in my wardrobe.

#### "I'm wearing a sheep!" üêë

One of the biggest changes I made in 2023 to prepare for this trip was to switch from a mostly cotton wardrobe to a mostly merino wool wardrobe. Merino wool is anti-microbial, fast drying, and temperature regulating. By changing from doing one load of laundry a week to hand-washing my clothes each evening, I was able to go from 36 cotton t-shirts down to 4 merino wool t-shirts. The change cascaded from there across my wardrobe as I selected less, but higher quality items in each category of clothing I use. What I ended up with is an entire wardrobe that can fit in a cary on suitcase. What's more, I really enjoyed the process and along the way found some of my favorite clothes I've ever owned. I've come to enjoy the process of hand washing my clothes each evening and the joy of owning only clothing items that I love has impacted me more than I expected.

#### Body care products update üßº

Another, smaller but equally helpful change I went through was with body care products. In 2023 I changed from liquid shampoo and conditioner to solid shampoo and conditioner. Not only does this help me contribute less plastics back into the world, but it also helps my travel rig last longer as I no longer have to worry about liquid limits when packing soap. I went through a similar change with deodorant. After years as a heavy antiperspirant user, I changed to a regular, natural deodorant. Again, this is one less plastic item that I need to buy and dispose of, but more importantly, my skin is much healthier and it takes much less work to keep my shirts clean *(antiperspirant in the quantities I was using it used to leave hard to remove stains in all my shirts.)*

#### So, what am I actually bringing?

This list is still evolving as of the first publication of this blog post. My plan is to continue to iterate on the choices represented here, and to add more detail about the reasoning behind selecting each item in the list. Creating this content is quite a time investment, but my hope is that it will help future adventurers see one way to methodically build the best travel rig for themselves.

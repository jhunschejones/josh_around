I enjoy crafting beautiful videos and sharing stories about the things I've learned on my adventures. I'm currently posting these on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@josh_around/videos" target="_blank">@josh_around</a>  YouTube channel.
Please stop by and and watch some whenever you like! üçø
